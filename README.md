# A-Deep-learning-Based-Patient-Care-application-for-skin-cancer-detection
this repository contains several deep learning models which take melanoma images as input and produce a prediction toward individual patient's general skin health.
All codes were written under Google Colab environment, which is also the recommended environment to run these codes, as Google drive is required to load fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks components of the model.
